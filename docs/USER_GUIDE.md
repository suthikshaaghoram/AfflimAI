## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is my data saved?**  
A: Your form data is saved locally on the server for the auto-fill feature. Each user's last submission is stored to make repeat usage convenient.

**Q: Can I use AfflimAI without astrological details?**  
A: Yes! While astrological inputs enrich the manifestation, you can enter "General" or "Unknown" if you don't have these details.

**Q: How long does manifest generation take?**
