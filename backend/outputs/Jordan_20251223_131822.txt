You are aware in this moment, Jordan, and that awareness is your starting point. You feel the readiness within you, a quiet certainty that has been building through every experience that shaped you. Your inner strength is not a question; it is the fact of your being, as solid as the ground beneath you. Remember the creative force that launched a community art program, the adaptable spirit that learned how to reach those fifty young hearts.
