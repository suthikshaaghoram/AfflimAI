You are already aware, Jordan, of the readiness that hums within you. You feel it in the quiet moments, this certainty that you are on the cusp of a significant and aligned shift. Your birth under the seeker's star, Mrigashirsha, speaks to your innate curiosity, and your Leo lagna fuels the creative fire you are now learning to direct with purposeful grace. This awareness itself is your first act of creation. Your strength is not a distant promise; it is present in your breath, in the steady beat of your heart that carried you across a half-marathon finish line.
